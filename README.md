# Node JS powered Professional README File Generator

* For this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a command line application using Node JS and the Inquirer package to create a professional readme file template that, when ran, the application will run through a series of questions, which is where the user provides the data to populate the readme file in all the appropriate sections! It is also dynamically creating a License Badge and hyperlink to the appropriate license chosen by the user in the prompts! This will be really helpful for me going forward in makign readme files!
